Our final project for Cis 520 Machine Learning

The Task give to us was to predict the gender of twitter
We were given information about the users usage of the 5000 most used words on twitter, their profile pictures(an array of pixels), and 7 features of the image

We were able to manage 90% accuracy using an Adaboost
